# Tuples have only two built-in methods:
# count(): Counts occurrences of a value.
# index(): Finds the index of the first occurrence of a value.
example_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(example_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 1
print(example_tuple.index(5))  # Output: 4

#You can convert a list to a tuple using the tuple() constructor:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)

# How do you handle unpacking of tuples when the number of elements is not fixed?
# You can use the "extended unpacking" feature introduced in Python 3. If you donâ€™t know the number of elements in advance, you can use the * operator to capture multiple elements:
a, *rest, b = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(a)     # Output: 1
print(rest)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(b)     # Output: 5

# What are some common use cases for tuples in Python?
# Returning Multiple Values: Functions can return multiple values as a tuple.
# Fixed Collections: Tuples are used to group related pieces of data that should not be changed.
# Dictionary Keys: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are immutable and hashable.
# Unpacking: Tuples are used in unpacking assignments for extracting multiple values from iterables.
